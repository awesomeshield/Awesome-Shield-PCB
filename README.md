# Awesome-Shield-PCB-0.5

This repo is for Awesome Shield hardware development.

## Versions and Branches

Variants are being developed in branches to preserve version history. These variants will be produced, assembled, and tested. From these prototypes one variant will be selected for further development.

Hardware Version Number | Branch Name
------  | -----
V0.50 | `rightSideUI`
V0.51 | `master`

The branch `unusedVariants` is used to retain version history of variants that have been deprecated.

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

The [BOM for this board](https://octopart.com/bom-lookup/NXcyO8GW) is being developed on octopart.

A bill of materials is a complete list of all of the electronic components that one needs to assemble the complete device. This does not include the PCB (PCB designs are stored in this git repository).

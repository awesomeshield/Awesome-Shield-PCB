# Awesome-Shield-PCB-0.5

This repo is for Awesome Shield hardware development.

## Versions and Branches

Three variants are being developed. These variants will be produced as 1- or 2-off PCBs, assembled, and tested. These prototypes will be tested, and one variant will be selected for further development.

The three variants are stored in branches, to preserve independent version history.

Hardware Version Number | Branch Name
------  | -----
V0.50 | `CPver2`
V0.51 | `CPvar6`
V0.52 | `master`

The branch `unusedVariants` is used to retain version history of variants that have been deprecated.

# Board Specifications for RFQ

Thickness = 1.6mm
Solder mask color = RED
coating = ENIG
copper weight = 1oz
layers = 2
Must be RoHS compliant
Solder residue must be cleaned from boards

# Notes for RFQ

## Panelization
We plan to panelize the board. Please let us know what panel size would be most cost effective with your production equipment. Tabs will be moved from their current positions when the board is panelized. We will not use V-scoring.

## Substitute Parts
We are interested in substituting analogous components from suppliers you use frequently in order to reduce costs, if possible.

## Anticipated changes
- will likely add one more 4pin connector (same as J1, J2) but not change the dimensions of the board
- silkscreen will become more complex and ornate
- we have yet to design the QC release testing mechanism, or add QC contacts to the board

## Anticipated schedule
January: Receive Quotes
February-March: Marketing / run Kickstarter campaign
April: adjust PCB design / BoM (DFM, consider adding one more component)
May: prototype adjusted design, test, fix any issues
June: source the production BoM
July: production
August: 1 month of "buffer" in case anything takes longer than expected
September: package + ship to customers

## Information requested in Quote

for production runs at 250, 500, 1k, 2.5k, 5k units
- costs (setup costs, unit costs)
- time from order to finished product
- amount of notice required for manufacturing run

- cost & time requirement of producing 2 test PCBAs
- clear explanation of how much of the supply chain you can manage (ie. will your firm order components from suppliers, or will Awesome Shield?)
- recommended panel size

Any thoughts that you share on possible cost saving measures will be welcome!
